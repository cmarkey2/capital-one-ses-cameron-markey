This repository contains all code for Cameron Markey's winning website for the Capital One Software Engineering Summit Coding Challenge for Summer 2020. This coding challenge was part 2 of the application process to be considered for this Summit. Being a freshman in college, I went from having no experience with building a website to having a working website using JavaScript, PHP, AJAX, HTML, CSS, and multiple REST APIs within two weeks!
