# capital-one-ses-cameron-markey
This repository contains all code for Cameron Markey's Capital One SES Coding Challenge for Summer 2020. Being a freshman in college, I went from having no experience with building a website to having a working website using multiple APIs within two weeks! Thank you so much for this oppurtunity, as it has pushed me to gain so much knowledge about using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP. :)
